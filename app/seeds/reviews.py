Upon arrival I thought the tv looked great - I liked the colors and resolution. I also honestly couldn't tell a difference between it and the 5 series (which I had gone to see in store before I ordered). I only stream shows, I don't game, so my bar is probably lower. However, after a couple hours of watching I started getting these flashing rectangles at the top of the screen. I called amazon and they arranged for a replacement. Unfortunately, the replacement arrived broken due to shipping. Sooo I called Amazon again and they arranged for another replacement. That one arrived yesterday; colors and resolution looked good UNTIL after a couple hours it started to do the flashing rectangle thing again at the top of the screen (see pics and video). So at this point I'm returning it and going to buy another brand in store. Amazon customer service is great, however, and they made returns and replacements no hassle. I wish it had worked out because I loved my old TCL and Roku platform (and in my opinion this TV looks great for the price) but unfortunately looks like the panel lottery is not in my favor this time around.",
